1) Given a string and two non-negative interger n and m, we need to get a string consisting of first n number of letters be repeated m numbers of time from the original string. Take input from console.

input 'Chocolate' 2  3 → 'ChChCh'
input 'Chocolate' 5 2 → 'ChocoChoco'
input 'Abc' 3 0 → ''

2) Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself

'restart' -> resta$t

3) Write a Python program to check if a given key already exists in a dictionary.

4) Write a Python script to swap the first and last charecters of all strings in a list, then reverse the list. Take input from console only.

5) Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.

6) Take two lists, say for example these two:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:
Randomly generate two lists to test this
Write this in one line of Python (don’t worry if you can’t figure this out at this point - we’ll get to it soon)

7) Rock Paper Scissor game : Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)
Rules

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock

8) Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.). Take this opportunity to practice using functions.

9) Determine if a sentence is a pangram.
Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma, "every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. The best known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." 
Take input from console only.

10) Write a program that given a phrase can count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.
Take input from console only.
For example for the input "olly olly in come free"
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
